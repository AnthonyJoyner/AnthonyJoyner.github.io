## About Me
Currently, I am a Freshman at Morgan State University, located in Baltimore, Maryland. I'm currently majoring in Physics but I plan on changing my major to Mathematics. I'm expected to graduated in 2027. I don't really know what I want to do with my degree just yet, but I plan on doing what feels the best according to my interests and skillset.
