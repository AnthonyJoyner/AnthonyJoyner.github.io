I forgot to upload an entry for last week so I'm going to go over both weeks here (^ ^)/.

There wasn't much work done in terms of our research project since we were preparing for our Midway Symposium.
I did create a prototype for the game to be played in and recorded a demonstration to present at the symposium,
but there wasn't much else to do besides preparing material for the presentation. The presentation was supposed
to take place this Wednesday but was delayed until next week, possibly due to technical difficulties. I'm fine 
with it but some my team was a bit upset since they prepared themselves mentally for it. As for the Friday after
July 4th, there wasn't much to do since everything had mostly been prepared. I'm a little worried standing in front 
of an audinence but I think everything should be fine in the end once I get on stage. I dont think that's how it's 
supposed to work but that's just how it is (- -;).
