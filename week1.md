I ended up meeting with Dr. Crawford and my mentors to discuss the project 
that I'll be working on and gained some insight as to what Dr. Crawford is looking for 
in this project. I was a bit behind since i forgot to do some things beforehand but
im catching up everso slowly. I even met some people from my previous semester which
was a litte suprising. We learned some basic coding skills since the group was
pretty varied in terms of coding knowledge and I managed to learn a lot in such a short
time frame. It was pretty exhausting on my mental typing for hours straight but I'll
probably end up doing much more later. For it being the first week it wasn't to
far from what I expected. It'll be a interesting challenge to see how long I last in this 
eye-opening program.
