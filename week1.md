I ended up meeting with my mentors to discuss the project that we'll be working on
and gained some insight as to what Dr. Mack is expecting from usin this project.
I was a bit behind since i forgot to do some things beforehand butim catching up
everso slowly. I even met some people from my previous semester whichwas a litte
suprising. We learned some basic coding skills since the group waspretty varied
in terms of coding knowledge and I managed to learn a lot in such a shorttime frame.
It was pretty exhausting on my mental typing for hours straight but I'llprobably end
up doing much more later. For it being the first week it wasn't tofar from what I
expected. It'll be a interesting challenge to see how long I last in this eye-opening program.
