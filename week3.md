I'm a little mentally exhausted after this week. I will admit it ws my
fault, but I probably would've passed out. There were assingments that I
missed in the past that came up so that took most of my time. I really
need to get my work in order so that it doesn't cause a negative chain 
reaction like this time. We ended up working on and presenting our Figma
pages and Literature Review Presentations and I think I was the worst
among the 3 groups under Dr. Mack. As well, there's a pretty distinct
sense that she's upset with my work. I'll need to improve my work
exponentially so that I don't upset her again!
