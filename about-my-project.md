## About My Project

Mind Mastery

Problem: There is a lack of solutions regarding training time, fatigue, control settings, etc.

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

- Capture neurological data such as certain neural oscillations triggered by specific responses from the nervous system.
- Process data and classify thoughts/actions such as gestures (e.g., jaw movements) and oscillation frequencies.
- Map output from neurological sensors to a digital game/puzzle.
  
Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a game requiring the use of headgear and neural imputs to be played and cleared successfully. This should be acomplishable with minimal training involved as to prevent fatigue.
