This week felt a bit less stressful. It is partially dueto not being 
in the office for 2 days, but I was able to accomplish more than I
thought that I would. We not only had a day of from the program on
Juneteenth, but also went on a field trip to NASA the day after.
It was pretty interesting but I definitely thought we could go to an 
observatory to look at the stars or something but oh well (˘･_･˘).
We had to document a design for a game of our own and create a wireframe
to display the idea to the rest of the group.The halfway point is starting
to be clearer and that brings some mixed feelings. On one side it's the
halfway point, but on the other we need to have a finished project to
display to the entire program. It does bringsome nerves and worries if I
complete the game in time, but I can only do what I know I can do, and that is to perservere.
