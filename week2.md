The main focus of this week was to catch up with everyone else, let me give some context. Most if not all teams had been selected for different studies prior to week 1 and doing it before the program started was recommended. Sadly I was one of the few to neglect that heads up and I had to grind through the entire week. Very exhausting doing unpaid overtime at home but I had no other choice but the week was pretty average otherwise. The Unity "tutorial" take around 30-35 hours to complete which is doable over 5 days. However, we planned to have a show and tell at the end of the week where we showcase everything we learned/made which brings that down to 24-28 hours. I have never hustled faster to get this tutorial done. Making 5 fully-coded games is a task in itself and I've learned to never put off work for that exact reason. Time went by faster than expected but it was just as unique as the first week. Now that I have a foothold I shouldn't fall behind again, hopefully.
