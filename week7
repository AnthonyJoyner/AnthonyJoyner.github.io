This week felt a little chaotic but much more productive. ╰(*°▽°*)╯

The CodeBears summer program had started for 5th-9th Graders. They have a buch more energy than I thought
but seem to having a blast so far. We're gonna be jumping in to help the mentors with the program from 
time to time. ヾ(•ω•`)o

We also had our Midsummer Symposium this Wednesday! I was pretty nervous since our project was the one
most people wanted and I didn't know if I could answer everyone's questions. The presentation itself was
actually pretty smooth and there were suprisingly not a lot of questions. I guess we explained everything
thoroughly. The next thing is the Final Symposium that's coming in around 3 weeks. We'll need to have the
project finished by then. ლ(╹◡╹ლ)

As for things happening on the development side. I wawws tasked with handling configurations with Keyboard
Controls so that we can use those as a basis for the gyroscopic element in our game. The scripting was a
lot harder than it would be. Finding the actual code needed wasn't to hard, but finding out how it's
supposed to be used was much harder than I thought. Through trial and error I managed to finish before the
end of the week. Next week is integration week (and maybe some design) so I'll need to help make sure this
game runs smoothly. (ˉ▽ˉ；)...
